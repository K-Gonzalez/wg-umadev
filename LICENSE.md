# Kantara Initiative - Intellectual Property Notice

Kantara Initiative is a non-profit membership organization that connects businesses, consumers, governments, and citizens through innovations and programs that support more natively trustworthy on-line experiences. The mission of KI is to foster identity community harmonization, interoperability, innovation, and broad adoption through the development criteria for operational trust frameworks and deployment/usage best practices for privacy-respecting, secure access to trusted online services.

The documents in this space are being developed by Kantara Initiative's User-Managed Access (UMA) Developer Resources Work Group, which operates under the [Kantara IPR Policy - Option Apache](http://kantarainitiative.org/confluence/display/GI/Option+Apache).

We invite your participation in the Work Group. For more information, see the [UMA Dev wiki](http://kantarainitiative.org/confluence/display/umadev/Home).
