##A beginning to the javascript dev design idea.

* API is still in design phase. 
* For now I have set up basic HTTP functionality with 'fake' endpoints 
  so that if Angular is a good option the template may already be in place.
* Objects for RSOwner and ResourceSet are incomplete and are dependent on RS implementation
* restTest.html and the app module controller, restTestController, are just for testing that Angular is referenced properly 
  and that REST GET call was working properly with an example of how to utilize the response.
  
# RUN Node server

* Type "server.sh" in Linux terminal
* Type "server.bat" in Windows

* The file in scripts/web-server will then handle setup of the Node server to listen
